## 5 海外优青
My first try was during 2021-2022 when I thought it is a easy step. I thought it would be inteviews like other jobs, but it turnes out like a grant. I have friends that planed more than a year with their advisor's helping them. But I can't find help now, so I give up. And I don't plan to go back home country in near future.


The best chance is that: you have >= 3 10+ IF(impact factor) papers, or one CNS paper + one 10+ IF paper. Your studies have focused in one main scientic area, novelty and has potential benifit in public health or business gains. You also need to propose your new research idea.

## 6 Job in US, PI/scientist
Not at this level yet.

## 7 EB-1A
I had no interest in obtaining a US green card untill I decided longer stay in US. That I missed the opportunity of COVID free waiting for filing of I-485.

I love my county and I don't intend to be a US citizen. But I am also a advocator of "no county" because every contry want to make their own good, may good or not good for the rest of the world. Like the TV/radio news you can hear from different countries. Take care of yourself and your family.

Because too many people form China and India are applying US green card, people from the two contries need to wait in line untill they proceed your case. It could be years especially if you apply EB-2/NIW.

Filing EB-1A turns out similar to grant things, you summarize your studies into 3-4 topocs with your publications. I bought lawyer service at WeGreened and my case have been processed. I am now waiting for the next step. 

I am not sure what questions there are wantted, but seems this is a topic of interest. Leave it here now.
